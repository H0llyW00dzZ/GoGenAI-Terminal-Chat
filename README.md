## ü§î Why Continue Development?

Interesting to built it in terminal after touring journey through the Go programming language, plus exploring Google's AI capabilities (currently in beta with Gemini).

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is specifically designed to adhere to idiomatic Go principles. ü§™

### üõ†Ô∏è Continued Development: Rationale and Benefits

- Embarking on a development journey that combines the robustness of the Go programming language with Google's cutting-edge AI capabilities (presently in beta with the Gemini model) offers several compelling advantages. This decision to develop a terminal-based application stems from a thorough exploration of Go's features and Google AI's potential.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Scalability & Stability

- Developing in Go promotes scalability. Its performance-centric design supports concurrent processing and efficient resource management, making it an excellent choice for applications that need to scale seamlessly with increasing demand.

- Go's memory management and static typing significantly reduce the occurrence of critical bugs such as memory leaks, which are prevalent in interpreted languages. This stability is crucial for long-running terminal applications that interact with AI services.

> [!NOTE]
> `Memory leaks` are a critical concern, particularly in AI development. Go's approach to memory management sets it apart, as it mitigates such issues more effectively than some other languages. This is in stark contrast to numerous repositories in other languages where memory leaks are a frequent and often confusing problem (that I don't fucking understand when looks other repo in `github`).

### üõ°Ô∏è Security

- Go's strong typing and compilation checks contribute to a more secure codebase, effectively minimizing critical security issues often encountered in dynamically typed languages,
for example in `GitHub` that I don't fucking understand.

### üö® Problem Isolation

- When issues arise, Go's explicit error handling makes it easier to compare and isolate problems. This clarity ensures that when an issue occurs, it can often be determined that the cause is external to the Go application, such as an issue with the Operating System, AI Services (Google AI) for example about AI Service is that a fucking google apis are unstable.


***Fun Fact***: ***Did You Know?*** If your `Go` code resembles a jungle of `if` statements (think 10+ nested layers ‚Äì a big no-no!), it's less `Go` and more `Stop-and-ask-for-directions`. Flatten those conditionals and let your code run as smoothly as a greased `gopher` on a slip 'n slide! ü§™

## ‚ú® Current Features

- **Terminal-Based Interaction**: Experience AI chatting within the comfort of your terminal, with a focus on simplicity and efficiency.
- **Session Chat History**: Maintain a transcript of your dialogue, capturing both queries and AI responses for a continuous conversational flow.
- **Intelligent Shutdown**: Benefit from built-in signal handling for a smooth exit process, ensuring your session ends without disruption and with proper resource cleanup.
- **Realistic Typing Animation**: Enjoy a more lifelike interaction with a simulated typing effect that mimics human conversation timing.
> [!NOTE]
> This `Realistic Typing Animation` specialized feature is economical in terms of resource consumption (e.g, `memory,cpu`), in contrast to `front-end languages` or `other languages` that tend to be more resource-intensive.
- **Ease of Deployment**: Quickly deploy the chat application using Docker, minimizing setup time and complexity.
- **Command Handling**: Integrate special chat commands naturally within the conversation. The `:quit` command, for example, allows users to end their session in an orderly fashion. When this command is executed, it prompts a cooperative shutdown sequence with the AI, which generates an appropriate goodbye message. This thoughtful design enhances the user experience by providing a conversational closure that is both natural and polite, ensuring that the session termination is as engaging as the conversation itself.
- **Concurrency**: Leverage the power of Go's concurrency model with goroutines.
- **Minimalist Package**: `DebugOrErrorLogger`
The `DebugOrErrorLogger` package offers a streamlined and efficient logging system, designed specifically for Go applications that require robust error and debug logging capabilities with minimal overhead.

### üõ†Ô∏è üì¶ Minimalist Package `DebugOrErrorLogger` Key Features

- üîé **Conditional Debug Logging**: The logger allows for debug messages to be conditionally output based on the `DEBUG_MODE` environment variable. When set to `true`, detailed debug information will be printed to `os.Stderr`, aiding in the development and troubleshooting process.

- üé® **Color-Coded Error Output**: Errors are distinctly colorized in red when logged, making them stand out in the terminal for immediate attention. This colorization helps in quickly identifying errors amidst other log outputs.

- üò± üîã **Panic Recovery**: A recovery function is provided to gracefully handle and log any panics that may occur during runtime. This function ensures that a panic message is clearly logged with colorized output, preventing the application from crashing unexpectedly and aiding in rapid diagnosis.

- ‚ö° **Simple API**: The package exposes a simple and intuitive API, with methods for debug and error logging that accept format strings and variadic arguments, similar to the standard `Printf` and `Println` functions.

- üîì ‚öôÔ∏è **Environment Variable Configuration**: The debug mode can be easily toggled on or off through an environment variable, allowing for flexible configuration without the need to recompile the application.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Current Features` listed above may be outdated. For the most recent feature updates, please read the documentation [`here`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/H0llyW00dzZ/GoGenAI-Terminal-Chat/terminal).


### ‚öñÔ∏è Enhanced Scalability

- **Modular Command Framework**: The system now employs a modular command framework that maps commands to dedicated handler functions. This design simplifies the addition of new commands and the modification of existing ones, reducing complexity and improving maintainability. It's a scalable approach that can easily grow with the application's functionality, accommodating an expanding set of features without cluttering the command processing logic.
- **Streamlined Codebase**: By decoupling command logic from the main interaction flow, the codebase becomes more organized and easier to navigate. Developers can quickly identify where to add new command handlers and understand how commands are processed, leading to a more developer-friendly experience.
> [!NOTE]
> The term `Streamlined Codebase` refers to a high-level, common pattern in `Go` programming. This pattern emphasizes a clean and well-organized structure, which facilitates understanding and maintaining the code. It typically involves separating concerns, modularizing components, and following idiomatic practices to create a codebase that is both efficient and easy to work with.
- **Flexible Command Extension**: The new structure allows for the easy integration of additional commands as the system evolves. Whether it's implementing administrative controls, user preferences, or new AI features, the command framework is designed to handle growth efficiently and logically.

> [!NOTE]
> This specialized feature, better than code resembles a jungle of `if if if if` statements has been successfully integrated.

By adopting this scalable command handling system, the chat application is well-positioned to evolve alongside advancements in AI and user expectations, ensuring a robust and future-proof user experience.

> [!NOTE]  
> Subject planning to continuously improve and add features, enhancing functionality without adding unnecessary complexity. Stay tuned for updates!

**`Go`** is designed to be straightforward and efficient, avoiding the unnecessary complexities (fuck complexities, this is `go` anti complexities) often encountered in other programming languages.

### üöÄ Better Performance ‚ö°

- **Optimized Resource Utilization**: GoGenAI Terminal Chat is engineered to maximize performance while minimizing resource usage. By leveraging Go's efficient compilation and execution model, the application ensures rapid response times and low overhead, making it ideal for systems where resource conservation is paramount.

- **Efficient Concurrency Management**: Thanks to Go's lightweight goroutines and effective synchronization primitives, GoGenAI Terminal Chat handles concurrent operations with ease. The application can serve multiple users simultaneously without significant increases in latency or memory usage, ensuring consistent performance even under load.

### üìå High Quality Go Codes

This repository contains high-quality Go code that focuses particularly on `Retry Policy Logic`, `Chat System Logic` and `Other`. Each function is designed for `simplicity`, deliberately avoiding unnecessary `stupid complexity`, even in scenarios that could potentially exceed a `stupid complexity` score of `10+`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

## Example how it work

ü§ì You: hello are you ?

ü§ñ AI: : I am a large language model, trained by Google.

ü§ì You: I have question about k8s, How do I enable audit logging in Kubernetes, and what should I look for when analyzing the logs?

ü§ñ AI: To enable audit logging in Kubernetes, you can use the following steps:

1. Edit the Kubernetes API server configuration file, typically located at `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`.
2. Add the following configuration under the `audit-policy` section:

```
enabled: true
```

3. Optionally, you can configure the following settings:

   - `policyFile`: The path to a file containing the audit policy rules.
   - `logPath`: The path to the file where the audit logs will be stored.
   - `logFormat`: The format of the audit logs.
   - `maxBatchSize`: The maximum number of audit events to include in a single batch.
   - `maxBatchWait`: The maximum amount of time to wait for a batch of audit events to be filled before writing them to disk.

4. Save and restart the Kubernetes API server.

Once audit logging is enabled, you can analyze the logs to gain insights into the activity on your Kubernetes cluster. Some things you may want to look for include:

- Successful and failed authentication and authorization attempts
- Create, update, and delete operations on Kubernetes resources
- Changes to cluster configuration
- API calls that take a long time to complete
- Errors and warnings generated by the Kubernetes API server

By analyzing the audit logs, you can identify security risks, troubleshoot issues, and gain a better understanding of how your Kubernetes cluster is being used.

Here are some additional resources that you may find helpful:

### ‚ö° Another Example

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PxjZ0Dz.png" alt="gopher" />
</p>

```sh
$ go run cmd/main.go
```

ü§ñ AI: Hello! How can I assist you today?

ü§ì You: I have question does this correct about "Strive for simplicity in each function (aim for a cyclomatic complexity under 5 to demonstrate expertise); simplicity is a sign of Go programming mastery." ?

ü§ñ AI: Yes, the statement "Strive for simplicity in each function (aim for a cyclomatic complexity under 5 to demonstrate expertise); simplicity is a sign of Go programming mastery" is generally correct.

**Cyclomatic complexity** is a measure of the complexity of a function. It is calculated by counting the number of independent paths through the function. A high cyclomatic complexity indicates that the function is difficult to understand and maintain.

**Simplicity** is a key principle of Go programming. Go code is typically concise and easy to read. This makes it easier to understand and maintain.

**Aiming for a cyclomatic complexity under 5** is a good way to ensure that your functions are simple and easy to understand. This will help you to write better code and avoid introducing bugs.

Of course, there are times when it is necessary to write functions that are more complex. However, you should always strive for simplicity whenever possible.

Here are some tips for writing simple functions:

* Use short, descriptive variable names.
* Avoid nesting loops and conditionals.
* Use functions to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks.
* Document your functions clearly.

By following these tips, you can write simple, easy-to-understand functions that will make your code more maintainable and bug-free.

### Other:
- [ ] **Plan for Google Cloud Deployment**
> [!NOTE]
> The `Plan for Google Cloud Deployment` feature is intended to support cloud compatibility with Vertex AI capabilities once version v1.0.0 (this repository) is reached and considered stable [read here](https://pkg.go.dev/about#best-practices).

**Why?** This project is developed in compliance with the `Terms of Service` and `Privacy Policy` for `personal use`. It's important to note that this project is developed on a personal basis during my free time and is not associated with any company or enterprise endeavors. This contrasts with many companies that primarily cater to enterprise needs. For instance, `Vertex AI` capabilities can be utilized on a personal basis for tasks such as fine-tuning and using your own data, without the complexity and overhead typically associated with enterprise-level requirements.
