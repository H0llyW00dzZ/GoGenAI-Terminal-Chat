## Why Continue Development?

Interesting to built it in terminal after touring journey through the Go programming language, plus exploring Google's AI capabilities (currently in beta with Gemini).

## Features (Subject to add more in future.)

- **Terminal-Based Interaction**: Experience AI chatting within the comfort of your terminal, with a focus on simplicity and efficiency.
- **Session Chat History**: Maintain a transcript of your dialogue, capturing both queries and AI responses for a continuous conversational flow.
- **Intelligent Shutdown**: Benefit from built-in signal handling for a smooth exit process, ensuring your session ends without disruption and with proper resource cleanup.
- **Realistic Typing Animation**: Enjoy a more lifelike interaction with a simulated typing effect that mimics human conversation timing.
