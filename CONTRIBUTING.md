### üéØ Contribution Guidelines

1. **Code Complexity**: Ensure that each function has a cyclomatic complexity of 5 or less. Pull requests with functions exceeding this complexity will not be accepted.
> [!TIP]
> If you're unable to write code that adheres to a cyclomatic complexity of 5 or less per function, you can refer to the Go tour [here](https://go.dev/tour/).
2. **Pull Requests**: You are encouraged to submit pull requests with improvements or new features that comply with our complexity rules.
3. **Issue Reporting**: If you find any problems or bugs, please report them by submitting an issue [here](https://github.com/H0llyW00dzZ/GoGenAI-Terminal-Chat/issues/new/choose).
