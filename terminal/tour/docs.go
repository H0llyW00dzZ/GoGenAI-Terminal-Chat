// Package tour provides a collection of string manipulation utilities.
// These utilities are designed to showcase idiomatic Go practices and
// offer simple, yet powerful functions for common string processing tasks.
//
// The package currently includes the following utilities:
//
//   - ConvertToBinary: Converts a string to its binary representation,
//     with each Unicode character represented by its binary equivalent.
//
// Additional functions will be documented here as they are added.
//
// The functions in this package are intended to be examples of clean,
// idiomatic Go code. They are suitable for educational purposes as well
// as practical use in Go projects that require string manipulation.
//
// Reasons for creating this package:
//
//   - To provide solutions that handle strings in a way that is safe and compatible with
//     operating system constraints, which may not manage constant strings effectively.
//     Note: This is not a problem with Go, but rather a problem with the operating system so bad.
