// Package tools encapsulates a collection of utility functions designed to support
// various common operations throughout the application. These utilities provide
// essential functionalities such as secure random string generation, data transformation,
// and system-level interactions, among others.
//
// The package aims to offer a centralized repository of tools that promote code reuse
// and maintainability. Each function within the package is implemented to be
// self-contained, with a clear purpose, minimal dependencies, and adherence to
// the principles of clean and idiomatic Go code.
//
// One of the foundational utilities is GenerateRandomString, which relies on the
// crypto/rand package from the Go standard library to produce cryptographically
// secure random strings. These strings are suitable for sensitive operations where
// unpredictability is crucial, such as generating unique identifiers or secure tokens.
//
// As the application evolves, the tools package is expected to grow with additional
// utilities that serve the emerging needs of the application while maintaining
// simplicity and efficiency.
//
// Usage of the tools package is intended to be straightforward, with each utility
// function being well-documented and accompanied by examples demonstrating its use.
